# IPL Data Analysis with PySpark

This project involves analyzing large-scale IPL (Indian Premier League) match data using PySpark. It implements structured pipelines for processing and querying ball-by-ball match events, team performances, and player statistics to gain insights from the dataset.

## Project Overview

- **Data Source**: IPL match data, including ball-by-ball events and match summaries.
- **Objective**: To process and analyze the data efficiently using PySpark to extract meaningful insights and trends about IPL matches and performances.
- **Technologies**: PySpark, Spark SQL, DataFrames.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw IPL data into a structured format using PySpark DataFrames.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing key metrics such as player performances, team statistics, and match outcomes.
- **Spark SQL Queries**: Writing and executing SQL queries on the IPL dataset to extract insights and perform aggregations.
- **Performance Optimization**: Leveraging PySpark for fast, distributed processing of large datasets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Apache Spark with PySpark
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the analysis in a notebook environment)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/meanderinghuman/ipl-data-analysis.git
    cd ipl-data-analysis
    ```

2. Install required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pyspark
    ```

3. (Optional) Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Running the Project

1. **Load Data**: Ensure the IPL dataset (e.g., CSV format) is available and loaded into your PySpark environment.
2. **Execute Analysis**: Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to perform the data transformations, queries, and analyses.
3. **Analyze Results**: Review the output, including team and player statistics, match summaries, and visual insights generated from Spark SQL queries.

## Example Queries

- **Top Performers**: Identify the top-scoring players across seasons.
- **Team Comparisons**: Compare the win/loss ratio of different teams across multiple seasons.
- **Player Insights**: Analyze key performance metrics for players such as runs scored, wickets taken, and more.

## Key Technologies

- **PySpark**: Distributed data processing for large-scale IPL datasets.
- **Spark SQL**: For querying structured data in DataFrames.
- **DataFrames**: Efficient handling of structured data in a distributed environment.
